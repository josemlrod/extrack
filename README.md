# Extrack

#### Summary

Simple app to track workouts, and to show total lifted volume over time

#### Entity struct

- Workout -> Set -> Repetitions

#### TODOs:

##### Critical

- [] Create the `/workouts` screen
  - [] Create a new workout
    - [] Add a set
    - [] Add a exercise
    - [] Add a repetition
  - [] Edit a workout
  - [] Delete a workout
- [] Create the `/progress` screen
  - [] Display a chart showing each exercise set + weight lifted
- [] Decide on a data structure for these entities

##### Nice to have:

- [] Smooth animation when switching between routes in `NavLinks`
